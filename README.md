AI Tab Bar: Your AI-Powered Spotlight üí°
The AI Tab Bar is a Mac utility designed to replace or augment the traditional macOS Spotlight search. It offers a seamless and quick way to get instant answers and complete tasks using the power of Artificial Intelligence directly from your desktop.

‚ú® Features
Global Access: Activate with a simple, customizable keyboard shortcut (e.g., Cmd + Shift + A) from any application.

Instant AI Answers: Get concise, accurate, and relevant responses to your questions powered by advanced language models.

Contextual Queries: Use AI for tasks like summarization, translation, code explanation, formatting, or creative writing right where you need it.

Clean Interface: A minimal, non-intrusive drop-down window that sits centrally, similar to macOS Spotlight, and disappears when not in use.

Customizable AI Source: Easily switch between different AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) via the settings.

History & Management: Automatically save past queries and conversation threads, making it easy to reference previous answers.
